Inspect event:

right click over the element, then "Inspect", then go to "Console" then write: 

----
monitorEvents($0)
----

To stop getting this data:

----
unmonitorEvents($0)

`$0` is just the last DOM element selected by Chrome Developer Tools

You can also specify event "type" as second parameter to narrow monitored events
to some predefined set. For example, 

----
monitorEvents(document.body, 'mouse')
----
