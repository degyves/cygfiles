== Send mail with msmtp

To get the certificates, install curl and execute `mk-ca-bundle.pl`, then move 
the 2 resulting files anywhere you want. Copy the file `~/.msmtprc.example` to
`~/.msmtprc` and replace the text accordingly.

Verify that it works, sending an e-mail from the shell: `msmtp user@gmail.com`.

We could send mutt running in the background and re-connect it to the terminal
with `reptyr` but currently it doesn't work on OSX.
